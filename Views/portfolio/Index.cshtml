                <h2>About Me</h2> <br>
                <p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio! My name is Michael White. 
                    I am 23 years old, and I am a full-stack software developer who is proficient in Python, C#, 
                    and MEAN stacks. . I strive to be able to create something that not only I can enjoy making 
                    as a developer, but that can provide enjoyment to those who use it and advance the human
                    condition. I also wish to cultivate my technical skillset. 

                </p>
